I have created an adventure game using ASP.NET Core for the web api and Angular 6 for the front-end.

Description:
You are trapped on an island, and need to escape. You need to build a boat and escape. Explore the island, replenish your health and gather resources. Beware of the dragon who is lurking in the shadows. Gather enough resourses, build a boat and head home!



STEPS TO RUN PROJECT:
1) Install node modules----> Navigate to 'angular' --> 'ClientApp' using command promt, once navigated run 'npm install' in prompt.
2) Open project in visual studio.
3) Run in visual studio
